    <td>all parameters are known; can beat humans because it can make calculations much faster</td>
    <td>- classification tasks o Able to use historical data to make predictions </td>
    <td>Able to learn with fewer examples because it understands motive and intent</td>

    <td>Incapable of dealing with scenarios including imperfect information or requiring historical understanding</td>
    <td>- Capable of complex tasks such as self-driving cars, but still vulnerable to outliers or adversarial</td>
